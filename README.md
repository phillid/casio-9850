What?
=====
This is a collection of tools which I am slowly writing to interact with Casio's
9850 series of scientific calculators.

At the moment, much of the serial code is stuff I knocked up with libserialport,
and this could (should?) probably be rewritten to reduce deps.

Dependencies
============

* libserialport
* Probably something else I've forgotten


Installation
============
The makefile doesn't yet provide an `install` recipe, so have fun.
